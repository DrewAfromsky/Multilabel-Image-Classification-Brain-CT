### Predicting intracranial hemorrhage in brain CT scans

### Three different classes for hemorrhage subtypes: epidural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid

## Future Work: addressing class imbalance/class weighting, creating trust scores for predictions, generate other performance metrics (mAP, precision-recall curve, ROC-AUC, F1/F2, sensitivity, specificity, etc.)
