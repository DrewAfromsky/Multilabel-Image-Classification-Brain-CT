# Multilabel-Image-Classification-Brain-CT

## Predicting intracranial hemorrhage in brain CT scans

## Three different classes for hemorrhage subtypes: epidural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid

![example](https://github.com/DrewAfromsky/Multilabel-Image-Classification-Brain-CT/blob/master/ich.png "example") 

## Future Work: addressing class imbalance/class weighting, creating trust scores for predictions, generate other performance metrics (mAP, precision-recall curve, ROC-AUC, F1/F2, sensitivity, specificity, etc.)
