## Predicting intracranial hemorrhage in brain CT scans

## Three different classes for hemorrhage subtypes: epidural, intraparenchymal, and subarachnoid

## **To-Do**: Address class imbalance (undersampling/oversampling, class weighting, ensemble resampling, SMOTE), train the feature extractor/backbone network, creating trust scores for predictions, generate other performance metrics (mAP, precision-recall curve, ROC-AUC, F1/F2, sensitivity, specificity, etc.)
